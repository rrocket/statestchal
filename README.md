you can run this on your local envrionment by first installing with npm (tested with node 12.22.8 and npm 6.14.15). I have set the maximum row size on the main table to 100 to keep the rerender times reasonable.
```
npm install
```

then run with

```
npm start
```

app will be served at http://localhost:8080/
